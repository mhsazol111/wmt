                Stacey Abrams is a New York Times bestselling author, serial entrepreneur, nonprofit CEO and political leader. After serving for

                Governor of Georgia, when she won more votes than any other Democrat in the state’s history. Abrams made history as the first Black
                woman to become the gubernatorial nominee for a major party in the United States. After witnessing the gross mismanagement of the 2018
                election by the Secretary of State’s office, Abrams launched Fair Fight Action to ensure every Georgian has a voice in the state’s
                elections and Fair Fight 2020 to defend voting rights nationally.
                <br />
                <br />
                Over the course of her career, Abrams has founded multiple organizations devoted to voting rights, training and hiring young people of
                color, and tackling social issues at both the state and national levels. In 2019, she launched Fair Count to ensure accuracy in the
                2020 Census and greater participation in civic engagement, and the Southern Economic Advancement Project, a public policy initiative
                to broaden economic power and build equity in the South. She is a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the 2012
                recipient of the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award, and serves on the Board of Directors for the Center for American Progress. Abrams
                is The New York Times bestselling author of Lead from the Outside: How to Build Your Future and Make Real Change (formerly Minority

                Michał Czubak born in Warsaw in 1980. He is a creator of original animations for documentaries, video projection mapping shows, TV
                spots and jingles, advertising films, TV graphics and his own short animated forms.
                <br />
                <br />
                His work is distinguished by the use of photos, maps, his own illustrations and other documents, which he animates and processes. This
                makes his style expressive and recognizable, balancing on the border between animated and documentary forms. In his documents, he
                deals with important social and political issues, but thanks to the creation of children style drawings, his works become much more
                accessible. They resemble dark fairy tales with the use of street art, collages and comics.
                <br />
                <br />
                He started creating animations in 2000. Since then, Michał Czubak has realized several hundred animation projects among all for TV
                brands such as Canal +, Planete, TVP, MTV, Comedy Central as an animator - graphic designer & animation director. In the years 2015 -
                2018 he was closely cooperating with BARTKRESA studio, a design and animation company that realizes video projection mapping projects
                all over the world. Michał created and directed several animated shows in Japan, USA and Qatar.
                <br />
                <br />
                One of his achievements was directing and creating in 2019 a three-minute animated movie for the 25th celebration of the Friends TV
                show that was projected on the highest skyscraper in the world: Burj Khalifa in Dubai. In the same year, the documentary "Passports to
                Paraguay," for which he created animations about Polish diplomats saving Jewish citizens from Holocaust, won the main prize at the
                11th Documentary Festival in Gdynia. Since the beginning of 2018 he has co-run the animation studio Czwarta Rano with Maciej
                Bałałuszko and Jarek Mankiewicz. One of the most important projects that they carried out last year, which Michał led, was the
                creation of animated films for the computer game Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts for CI Games.

                Lauren Groh-Wargo is a top political strategist, executive, and fighter for economic justice; and she is a key leader in shaping the
                emerging Democratic wave in the South. Most recently, Lauren served as the campaign manager for Stacey Abrams for Governor, a campaign

                Both are enrolled members of the Sicangu Oyate (Rosebud Sioux Tribe) and have 7 children. Both OJ and Barb received their Honorary
                Doctorate Degrees from the Clairmont Graduate University in recognition of their continuing involvement in the fight for voter
                equality.
                <br />
                <br />
                They are Co-Executive Directors of Four Directions Inc., a non-partisan voting rights advocacy organization that has worked with
                Tribes and its members on Federal Voting Rights litigations in Arizona, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Working with
                Minnesota Tribes in 2014, they established satellite voting offices on the three largest Indian reservations without litigation.
                <br />
                <br />
                OJ is the Executive Director of the Coalition of Large Tribes which consist of Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nations, the Oglala Sioux
                Tribe, the Crow Tribe of Montana, the Navajo Nation, the Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, the Blackfeet Tribe of Montana, the Rosebud

                In 1982, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter founded The Carter Center, a nongovernmental organization guided by a fundamental
                commitment to human rights and the alleviation of human suffering and OJ is part of the Carter Center as an International Observer and
                traveled to Kenya in 2017.
                <br />
                <br />
                Barb & OJ helped form Four Directions, Inc., after leading the historic Native vote project in South Dakota’s 2002 U.S. Senate race.
                For that effort, the 21st Century Democrats awarded Barb and OJ the 2003 Paul Wellstone Grassroots Award. Since then, Barb and OJ have
                continued to lead nonpartisan Native voter engagement, empowerment, protection and voting rights work across the country.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 2005, OJ Semans testified before the National Commission on the Voting Rights Act before the reauthorization of the Voting Rights
                Act in 2006, and in 2014 he testified again before the National Commission on the Voting Rights Act. OJ filed a friend-of-the-court
                brief in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder and Shelby County (Ala.) v. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. OJ
                & Barb found it ironic that the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling on June 25, 2013 which was the 137-year anniversary of the Battle
                of the Little Big Horn.
                <br />
                <br />
                OJ & Barb have always believed in creating unity with Tribes and Tribal Organizations and in August 2019 they created the first Native
                American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa and in January 2020 in Las Vegas Nevada bringing in the Native American Rights Fund
                and the National Congress of American Indian, Tribes and Tribal organizations throughout Indian Country. The forum brought all the top
                candidates to the forum including Vice President Joe Biden and created real dialog and addressed Voting Rights Issues.
                <br />
                <br />
                OJ’s opinion editorials have been featured in Indian Country Today Media Network, and has appeared on the Rachel Maddow Show, Politics

                Universities. They live in South Antelope on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota.

                <br />
                OJ & Barb were honored to be a part of the “All In: The Fight for Democracy” that features Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader

                Alejandra Gomez was born in Pomona, California to immigrant parents.Alejandra became aware of the US’ broken immigration system at a
                young age after Prop 187 was passed. Prop 187 was an anti-immigration law that targeted undocumented immigrants living in California
                in the mid-1990s. Alejandra’s father at the time was undocumented and Prop 187, forced Alejandra’s family to move to Arizona in hopes
                of escaping the dangers of Prop 187 and other anti-immigrant sentiment.
                <br />
                <br />
                Alejandra began her career in community organizing in 2007, during the beginning of Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s criminal suppression sweeps
                that were racially charged and targeted immigrant communities. Seeing the fear and harassment her community was experiencing and the
                remainder of her own childhood, Alejandra began working with Maricopa Citizens for Safety and Accountability to organize against
                Sheriff Arpaio and his unfair practices.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since her start in organizing, Alejandra has focused her work on immigration rights through large-scale civic engagement efforts to
                bring out the Latino vote and direct action. Alejandra lives in Phoenix, AZ and holds a B.A. in Political Science from Arizona State
                University. Alejandra was the Field Manager for the Adios Arpaio campaign that registered Latinos to vote during her time with the New
                Organizing Institute, worked for Organizing for America in Arizona and has dedicated her work not only to leading large scale voter
                registration efforts that surpassing 90,000 Latinos voters registered but also worked asa Deputy Organizing Director at United We
                Dream during the immigration reform push in 2013 and 2014. Rooted in her family's immigration struggle, Alejandra lead the organizing
                efforts in the fight for DAPA and expanded DACA at United We Dream National Network as the Deputy Organizing Director.
                <br />
                <br />

                In his sophomore year at Dartmouth, Michael Parsons began fighting back against legislation introduced by New Hampshire Republicans
                which sought to disenfranchise thousands ofcollege students in the Granite State. As a leading student voting rights activist in the
                state, Parsons helped coordinate an organizing campaign that brought student voices to the forefront of the debate on voting rights in
                New Hampshire while also including a large voter-education and turnout ground-game that led to record breaking youth-turnout in the
                2018 midterms. As President of the New Hampshire College Democrats throughout his senior year, Michael led another voter education and
                GOTV campaign which contributed to record-breaking turnout for students in the New Hampshire primary, while also raising an
                unprecedented amount of money for the organization so that student activists would be more than fully equipped to fight back against
                voter suppression and ensure their peers exercised their constitutionally enshrined right to vote in the 2020 election and beyond.
                After graduating in the Spring of 2020, Michael is continuing the fight for student voting rights as well as managing a State Senate
                campaign in New Hampshire.

                In the decades since Andrew Young helped change the course of the Civil Rights movement, he has built a remarkable legacy as a civic
                activist, elected official, groundbreaking ambassador, social entrepreneur, and adviser to presidents. Today, he leads the Andre J,
                Young Foundation’s efforts to develop and support new generations of visionary leaders who will create sustainable global approaches
                to economic development, poverty alleviation, and the challenge of hunger.
                <br />
                <br />
                Young attended segregated schools in New Orleans and graduated early from Howard University before attending Hartford Theological
                Seminary. It was during his time as a pastor in southern Georgia that he became active in the civil rights movement, organizing voter
                registration drives in 1954 in the face of death threats. After a few years with the National Council of Churches in New York, he
                returned to Georgia in 1961 to lead the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s “citizenship schools, working closely with Dr. King
                to teach non-violent organizing strategies. He was a key strategist and negotiator during campaigns that led to the passage of the
                Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 1972, Young was elected to Congress, becoming the first African American representative from the Deep South since Reconstruction.
                He sponsored legislation that established a U.S. Institute of Peace, The African Development Band and the Chattahoochee River National
                Park, while negotiating federal funds for MARTA (Metro Atlanta Rapud Transit Authority), the Atlanta highway system and a new
                international airport for Atlanta.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Young to serve as the nation’s first African American Ambassador to the United Nations.
                Young was an architect of the first U.S. Africa policy ground in human rights rather than simply cold war calculus, and he helped
                negotiate an end to white-minority rule in Namibia and Zimbabwe.
                <br />
                <br />
                Young was instrumental in the building of modern-day Atlanta. He was elected Mayor in 1981 and re-elected in 1985 with nearly 85
                percent of the vote. Hartsfield International Airport, whose development he championed, made it possible for Atlanta to attract 1,100
                new businesses, $70 billion in foreign district investment, and 1 million new jobs to the region during his tenure. It is now the
                busiest airport in the world. The city hosted the Democratic National Convention in 1988. Young also led the successful effort to
                bring the 1996 Olympic Games to Atlanta.
                <br />
                <br />
                Young’s involvement with Africa has continued in the years since his term as ambassador. President Bill Clinton appointed him founding
                chair of the Southern African Enterprise Development Fund, and in 1996 he co-founded Good Works International, where for more than 15
                years he promoted an approach to sustainable economic development in Africa and the Caribbean grounded in profitability and social
                responsibility. Through the Andre J. Young Foundation and its partnerships with international agencies and the private sector, he
                continues to focus on expanding educational opportunity as well as innovative approaches to alleviating hunger and poverty in the U.S.
                and abroad.
                <br />
                <br />
                Young is the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the French Legion d’Honneur and has received honorary degrees from
                more than 100 colleges and universities.
